## HTTP Verbs

HTTP verbs, also known as HTTP methods, are actions that indicate the desired operation to be performed on a resource. In the context of ASP.NET Core and web APIs, HTTP verbs are crucial for defining the actions that clients can perform on the server. Here's a summary of common HTTP verbs and their typical usage:

### Common HTTP Verbs

1. **GET**
   - **Usage**: Retrieves data from the server.
   - **Example**: Fetching a user profile (`GET /api/users/1`).

2. **POST**
   - **Usage**: Submits data to be processed by the server.
   - **Example**: Creating a new resource (`POST /api/users`).

3. **PUT**
   - **Usage**: Updates an existing resource with the provided data.
   - **Example**: Updating a user's information (`PUT /api/users/1`).

4. **PATCH**
   - **Usage**: Partially updates an existing resource with the provided data.
   - **Example**: Updating specific fields of a user (`PATCH /api/users/1`).

5. **DELETE**
   - **Usage**: Deletes the specified resource from the server.
   - **Example**: Deleting a user (`DELETE /api/users/1`).

6. **OPTIONS**
   - **Usage**: Retrieves the HTTP methods that the server supports for a given URL.
   - **Example**: Checking allowed methods for a resource (`OPTIONS /api/users`).

7. **HEAD**
   - **Usage**: Requests headers that would be returned if the `GET` request were to be made.
   - **Example**: Getting metadata about a resource (`HEAD /api/users/1`).

### Characteristics and Usage

- **Idempotent Operations**: `GET`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` methods are idempotent, meaning that performing the same request multiple times has the same effect as performing it once. `POST` and `PATCH` are not necessarily idempotent.
  
- **Safe Methods**: `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` are considered safe, meaning they should not modify the state of the server.

- **Semantic Meaning**: Each HTTP method has a specific semantic meaning and is used accordingly to adhere to RESTful principles in designing APIs.

### ASP.NET Core and HTTP Verbs

In ASP.NET Core Web API controllers, you can map these HTTP verbs to controller actions using attributes such as `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, `[HttpDelete]`, `[HttpPatch]`, etc. These attributes help in defining the routing and behavior of the API endpoints based on the HTTP method used.

#### Example:

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("api/users")]
public class UsersController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetUser(int id)
    {
        // Retrieve user logic
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateUser([FromBody] UserDto userDto)
    {
        // Create user logic
    }

    [HttpPut("{id}")]
    public IActionResult UpdateUser(int id, [FromBody] UserDto userDto)
    {
        // Update user logic
    }

    [HttpDelete("{id}")]
    public IActionResult DeleteUser(int id)
    {
        // Delete user logic
    }
}
```

### Summary

Understanding and correctly implementing HTTP verbs in ASP.NET Core APIs is essential for designing RESTful APIs that adhere to best practices and standards. Each HTTP method serves a specific purpose in interacting with resources on the server, facilitating effective communication between clients and the API.

## Status Codes

HTTP status codes are standard response codes given by web servers on the internet. They communicate the outcome of an HTTP request and provide information about the status of the request or the server's response. Here's an overview of some common HTTP status codes and their significance:

### 1xx - Informational

- **100 Continue**: The server has received the initial part of the request and is willing to continue processing.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is acknowledging the client's request to switch protocols, such as upgrading to WebSocket.

### 2xx - Success

- **200 OK**: The request has succeeded. Typically returned for successful `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` requests.
- **201 Created**: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created.
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content.

### 3xx - Redirection

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found (Moved Temporarily)**: The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not been modified since the last request.

### 4xx - Client Error

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to a client error, such as malformed syntax or invalid parameters.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication. Similar to 403, but specifically when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.

### 5xx - Server Error

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating that something has gone wrong on the server.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an inbound server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

### Importance and Usage

- **Client Understanding**: Status codes help clients understand the outcome of their requests and take appropriate action based on the response.
- **Server Communication**: They facilitate communication between servers and clients, indicating whether requests were successful, redirected, or encountered errors.
- **API Design**: When designing APIs, choosing appropriate status codes helps in creating clear and consistent responses, enhancing the usability and reliability of the API.

### Example Usage

```http
GET /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

In this example:
- `GET /api/users/123` is the request to fetch user with ID 123.
- `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` is the status line indicating the request was successful.
- `Content-Type: application/json` specifies the format of the response body.

Understanding HTTP status codes is essential for both developers and users interacting with web services. They provide critical feedback about the success or failure of requests, aiding troubleshooting and improving the overall user experience.
