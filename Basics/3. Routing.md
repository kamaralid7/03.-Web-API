## Routing
Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API and ASP.NET Core MVC serves a similar fundamental purpose of mapping incoming requests to action methods within controllers. However, there are notable differences in how routing is configured and used in each context:

### Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API:

1. **Attribute Routing**:
   - **Primary Approach**: ASP.NET Core Web API primarily uses attribute routing to define routes directly on controllers and action methods using attributes like `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, etc.
   - **Example**:
     ```csharp
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     [ApiController]
     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
     {
         [HttpGet]
         public IActionResult GetAllProducts()
         {
             // Logic to fetch and return all products
         }

         [HttpGet("{id}")]
         public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
         {
             // Logic to fetch and return product by ID
         }

         [HttpPost]
         public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] ProductDto productDto)
         {
             // Logic to create a new product
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Convention-based Routing**:
   - ASP.NET Core Web API supports convention-based routing but relies more heavily on attribute routing for defining API endpoints.
   - Convention-based routes can be configured in the `Startup.ConfigureServices()` method using `services.AddControllers()` or `services.AddControllersWithViews()`.

3. **HTTP Method Attributes**:
   - Actions are decorated with attributes like `[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, `[HttpPut]`, `[HttpDelete]`, etc., to specify the HTTP verb they handle and their route templates.

4. **Controller-level Routes**:
   - Controllers can have a base route defined at the class level using `[Route("[controller]")]`, where `[controller]` is replaced with the controller name.

### Differences from ASP.NET Core MVC Routing:

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Web API**: Focuses on exposing endpoints for data exchange (typically JSON or XML) between client applications and servers.
   - **MVC**: Primarily serves web pages and handles user interactions through views and controllers, generating HTML responses.

2. **Base Class**:
   - **Web API**: Controllers inherit from `ControllerBase` and focus on lightweight APIs without view-related features.
   - **MVC**: Controllers inherit from `Controller` and include features for rendering views (`View()`, `PartialView()`, etc.).

3. **Route Configuration**:
   - **Web API**: Uses attribute routing (`[Route]` attributes on controllers and actions) as the primary mechanism for defining routes.
   - **MVC**: Uses both attribute routing and convention-based routing (`MapRoute()` in `Startup.Configure()`) to define routes for web application requests.

4. **Content Negotiation**:
   - **Web API**: Supports content negotiation to deliver data in various formats (JSON, XML) based on client preferences specified in accept headers.
   - **MVC**: Renders views or returns HTML based on client preferences and accept headers, facilitating dynamic web page generation.

5. **Response Types**:
   - **Web API**: Returns data directly (`IActionResult`), often serialized as JSON or XML, for consumption by client applications.
   - **MVC**: Returns `ActionResult`, which can include views (`ViewResult`), partial views (`PartialViewResult`), or other content types based on the request.

### Summary:
Routing in ASP.NET Core Web API emphasizes attribute-based routing to define API endpoints for handling HTTP requests and delivering data responses. It is optimized for building RESTful APIs that expose CRUD operations and support content negotiation. Understanding these differences helps in choosing the appropriate framework (MVC vs. Web API) based on whether you're developing web pages with views or exposing APIs for data consumption.

## Attribute Routing

Attribute routing in ASP.NET Core provides a flexible way to define routes directly on controllers and action methods using attributes. This approach is particularly useful in ASP.NET Core Web API applications but can also be used in ASP.NET Core MVC for defining routes more explicitly. Here’s an overview of attribute routing in ASP.NET Core:

### Basics of Attribute Routing:

1. **Enabling Attribute Routing**:
   - Attribute routing is enabled by default in ASP.NET Core applications. To ensure it's enabled, make sure to include `services.AddControllers()` (for APIs) or `services.AddMvc()` (for MVC) in the `ConfigureServices` method of your `Startup` class.

2. **Route Templates**:
   - Routes are defined using route templates within `[Route]` attributes applied to controllers and action methods.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     [ApiController]
     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
     {
         [HttpGet]
         public IActionResult GetAllProducts()
         {
             // Logic to fetch and return all products
         }

         [HttpGet("{id}")]
         public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
         {
             // Logic to fetch and return product by ID
         }

         [HttpPost]
         public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] ProductDto productDto)
         {
             // Logic to create a new product
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Controller-level Routes**:
   - You can specify a base route for all actions within a controller by applying `[Route("[controller]")]` at the controller level. `[controller]` will be replaced with the controller name.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     [ApiController]
     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
     {
         // Actions like Get, Post, Put, Delete can be defined here
     }
     ```

4. **Action-level Routes**:
   - Action methods can have additional route templates appended to the base route defined at the controller level.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [Route("api/[controller]")]
     [ApiController]
     public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
     {
         [HttpGet("{id}")]
         public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
         {
             // Logic to fetch and return product by ID
         }

         [HttpPost("create")]
         public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] ProductDto productDto)
         {
             // Logic to create a new product
         }
     }
     ```

5. **Route Constraints**:
   - Constraints can be added to route parameters to restrict the values they can accept. Common constraints include `int`, `string`, `guid`, `bool`, etc.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [HttpGet("{id:int}")]
     public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
     {
         // Logic to fetch and return product by ID
     }
     ```

6. **Route Names**:
   - You can assign names to routes using the `Name` parameter in the `[Route]` attribute. This is useful for generating URLs in views or for referencing routes in your application.
   - Example:
     ```csharp
     [HttpGet("{id}", Name = "GetProductById")]
     public IActionResult GetProductById(int id)
     {
         // Logic to fetch and return product by ID
     }
     ```

### Differences from Convention-based Routing:

- **Convention-based Routing**: Typically configured using `app.UseEndpoints()` or `app.UseMvc()` in the `Startup` class, where routes are defined based on controller and action method names and HTTP verbs (`MapControllerRoute()` for MVC).

- **Attribute Routing Advantages**:
  - More explicit and readable route definitions directly on controllers and actions.
  - Supports complex route configurations and constraints.
  - Provides better control over API endpoint URLs and structure.

### Summary:

Attribute routing in ASP.NET Core offers a powerful way to define and manage routes directly within your controller classes and action methods. It enhances the clarity and flexibility of route definitions, making it ideal for building RESTful APIs and fine-tuning endpoint URLs and behaviors. Understanding how to leverage attribute routing effectively helps in designing more structured and maintainable ASP.NET Core applications.

## Convention Route

Conventional routing in ASP.NET Core provides a way to define routes based on conventions and defaults rather than explicitly specifying routes using attributes on controllers and actions. Here’s an overview of conventional routing in ASP.NET Core:

### Basics of Conventional Routing:

1. **Enabling Conventional Routing**:
   - Conventional routing is typically configured in the `Startup.Configure` method using `app.UseEndpoints()` for ASP.NET Core 3.x and later versions, or `app.UseMvc()` for earlier versions specifically targeting MVC applications.

2. **Default Route**:
   - By default, ASP.NET Core MVC applications use a convention-based route defined in `Startup.Configure`:
     ```csharp
     app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
     {
         endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
             name: "default",
             pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
     });
     ```
   - This default route maps URLs to controller actions based on the `{controller}`, `{action}`, and optional `{id}` placeholders in the URL.

3. **Controller and Action Naming Conventions**:
   - Routes are automatically generated based on the controller and action method names. For example, a `ProductsController` with an `Index` action would typically be accessible via `/Products/Index`.

4. **Additional Route Parameters**:
   - Additional route parameters can be specified in the `pattern` parameter of `MapControllerRoute`, allowing customization of route templates and default values:
     ```csharp
     endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
         name: "customRoute",
         pattern: "custom/{controller}/{action}/{id?}");
     ```
   - In this example, URLs like `/custom/Products/GetProductById/1` would map to the `GetProductById` action in the `ProductsController` with `id` as an optional parameter.

5. **Route Constraints**:
   - Route constraints can be applied using inline constraints or regular expressions within route patterns to restrict parameter values:
     ```csharp
     endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
         name: "default",
         pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id:int}");
     ```
   - Here, `{id:int}` ensures that `id` must be an integer.

6. **Area Routing**:
   - Areas allow organizing controllers and views into separate functional sections of an application. Routes can be defined within areas using `MapAreaControllerRoute`:
     ```csharp
     endpoints.MapAreaControllerRoute(
         name: "admin",
         areaName: "Admin",
         pattern: "Admin/{controller=Dashboard}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
     ```
   - This route maps URLs within the `Admin` area to controllers and actions defined in that area.

### Differences from Attribute Routing:

- **Explicitness**: Conventional routing relies on conventions and defaults, generating routes based on controller and action names.
- **Configuration**: Routes are typically configured centrally in the `Startup.Configure` method using `app.UseEndpoints()` or `app.UseMvc()`.
- **Flexibility**: Attribute routing provides more flexibility and control over route definitions directly within controllers and actions, supporting complex route templates and constraints.

### When to Use Conventional Routing:

- **MVC Applications**: Conventional routing is well-suited for traditional MVC applications where controllers and actions follow standard naming conventions and route templates can be standardized across the application.
- **Areas**: Useful for organizing large applications into logical sections (areas) with their own route configurations.

### Summary:

Conventional routing in ASP.NET Core provides a straightforward way to define routes based on naming conventions and defaults. It’s particularly effective for MVC applications where controllers and actions follow predictable patterns. Understanding how to configure and leverage conventional routing helps in designing maintainable and structured ASP.NET Core applications.
